### üìÉ Description
üï∏Ô∏è  __This application is a little old.__
__It does not best reflect my current practices, and it is currently in an incomplete state.__
__It lacks modularization, contains a few lines of deprecated code, and is generally messy.__
__This repository has been created to archive this past work. It may or may not be completed in the future.__

‚úèÔ∏è  __Estimated Last Modification Time:__  2021-2022

‚òï  __Written in Java Version:__  1.8

This is a simple application that allows the user to use a replica of the quick chat system in Psyonix's [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/).

__For any questions, please scroll down to the [F.A.Q.](https://github.com/Minimunch57/PCRLChat#-faq)__

### ‚ú® Features
- "Send" quick chat messages anywhere on your operating system using numbers 1-4, just like in the game.

### ‚ùì F.A.Q.
__What is Rocket League?__

>For more information on Rocket League, please visit the game's [website](https://www.rocketleague.com/).

__Are you affiliated in any way with Rocket League or its developers/owners?__
>__No.__  For credits and more information please scroll down to the [Additional Information](https://github.com/Minimunch57/PCRLChat#%E2%84%B9%EF%B8%8F-additional-information) section.

__Will this application ever be finished?__

>Maybe. I don't have plans to finish it at the moment, but it would not take much time to do so.

__What is the point of this application?__

>There is not really a *point* with this application. It is purely cosmetic and for fun.
I can imagine some sort of use that is comedic or entertaining, but that is highly situational.

__Why should I use this application?__
>As mentioned, there is no good reason to use it, other than for fun.
See how it would look and feel to use Rocket League-style quick chats on your computer outside of the game.
Do you stream the game? Use it as an entertainment tool when doing other things, or fork the repository, modify the code, and link it to donations.
These are just random ideas.
